# Python equivalent of a .bashrc

# .pythonrc runs every time i start the REPL to
# define my functions and set up my environment.
# Python checks for a special environment variable,
# called `PYTHONSTARTUP`, and if that variable is
# set to a path, it runs the file at that path.

# I added this line to my .envrc file:
# export PYTHONSTARTUP="$(pwd)"/.pythonrc

# enable tab completion
import rlcompleter, readline
readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")

# import my custom utils
from config.REPL.helpers import *
